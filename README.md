##General Description

This frontpage demo of [Twitter](https://twitter.com) was written over 
a weekend as a test exercise in working with responsive 
[HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) content, 
[CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_intro.asp) styling, and basic [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) 
functionality as part of the course at [Makers Mcademy](http://www.makersacademy.com/).

The guidlines for building the app were:

* To recreate the front-end of Twitter's feed page as close as possible to the real thing.
* This requires only HTML, CSS and JS (No need to create anything at the back-end)
* The mock-site should look good on the desktop. As a minimum it should have the header and 
  the list of tweets
* JavaScript functionality for infinite scrolling (using dummy data, no server-side content), 
  which will add more tweets when scrolling to the bottom of the page (with a spinner showing
  up and disappearing in-between).
* The mock-site should be responsive.


##Browsers

This app has been tested with and supports the following browsers (though it should hopefully
 look ok in other browsers as well):

* __Google Chrome__ (36.0)
* __Mozilla Firefox__ (31.0)
* __Apple Safari__ (7.0.5)
